## App Skeleton
The app skeleton has been based on React + Redux app. It has been designed as a mix of these sources:
 - Full App folders: https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit
 - SRC folder: https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc/src
## TODO: Investigate Tools folder: https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/master/tools
 - DEv Tools: https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate
 - Hot replacement React: https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/tree/next


## Dev Tools to use:
In order to use the quicker and best approach we will choose webpack-dev-server as a development server in order to have fast live reloading.
